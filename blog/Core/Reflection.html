          I did pretty well on the foundations. Instead of working mon-fri I
          ended up working wed-sun which meant I was pretty much handing my work
          in right at the end of each sprint. I probably played more video games
          than hours worked which I'm not very proud of, but once the in person
          bootcamp start I will be a lot more into the full time study. Working
          from home has always been a struggle for me so I'm glad I was able to
          power through the foundations.
