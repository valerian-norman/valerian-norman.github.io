        <h3 class="subtitle">What is the difference between IQ and EQ?</h3>
        <p>
          EQ is your social ability to understand others and process emotions,
          while IQ is your problem-solving ability<br />
          including memorization and critical thinking.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Emotion Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Having good Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is important for resolving
          conflicts and avoid misunderstandings,<br />
          not only can it help build relationships with people but it can also
          improve productivity and help you with your<br />
          studies or career. A strong EQ can help you be the best version of
          yourself, put more thought into your actions<br />
          and help you decide what really matters for you.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Colaborative Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          Looping is an exercise that you can do with a partner where one person
          talks for two minutes about a topic and<br />
          the second person has to listen. When the first person finishes
          talking then the second person repeats back what<br />
          they understood from the first person. If the second person got
          something wrong then the first person will clarify<br />what they got
          wrong. Repeat this process until both parties have an equal
          understanding of each other.
