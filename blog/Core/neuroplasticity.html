        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is what occurs when you are pacticing an activity and
          actively trying to improve. You can<br />
          learn a topic by studying it, but without practicing it and physically
          putting your knowledge to use, it will be<br />
          hard to carry certain techniques over from short to long term memory.
          A common misconception about the<br />brain is that we are born with a
          certain type of brain that will grow in a set way. But actaully,
          depending on<br />
          what you physically occupy your mind with but also what you think
          about can change the mental and physical<br />
          development of your brain.

        <p>
          After learning lots of knowledge, sometimes the best thing you can do
          is going to sleep and seeing how much<br />
          you can remember the next day
