          A long term goal of mine is to make a video game with well made code
          utilizing the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) method. I'm good at powering
          through the work when the deadline is very close but I can be easily
          distracted if I don't take my ADHD meds so time management is very
          important for me. I would like to be able to construct clean code in
          an organized mannor. When I start to get overwhelmed with my workload
          I will create a physical list of the things I need to finish and the
          things I need to finish those tasks. My course facilitators and
          house-mates will be a great source of knowledge and support and I will
          be the same for them.
